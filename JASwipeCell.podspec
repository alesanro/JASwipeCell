  s.description  = <<-DESC
                   A UITableViewCell subclass that displays customizable left or right buttons that are revealed as the user swipes the cell in either direction. The edge-most buttons will pin to the container view and will execute an event similar to how the delete/archive button work in IOS 8 mail. A great way to simulate IOS 8 mail's behavior.
